# GM8Emulator
An emulator for games created with GameMaker 8. This repo is no longer being developed and has been marked as read-only. The project has been broadened to "OpenGM8" and a more advanced version of this application, written in Rust, can be found [here](https://github.com/OpenGM8/GM8Emulator). You can build this if you want, but expect crashes, missing features and other noticeable issues.

## Building For PSP
- Clone the repository, make sure to grab submodules along with it (`--recurse-submodules` or `submodule update --init --recursive`)
- cmake command : psp-cmake -S . -B build/ then cmake --build build/
